FeeroLink Vision

üåå What is FeeroLink?

FeeroLink is a visual thinking-based knowledge architecture designed to explore, structure, and communicate what has previously been unrecognizable. It serves as a cognitive OS that models the brain of a Visual Thinker, enabling deep philosophical, emotional, and social structures to be rendered as navigable, dynamic visual systems.

üß† Core Philosophy

"Toward a world where the unrecognizable becomes recognizable"

Human dignity, silent trauma, and invisible systems are made visible through images, relationships, and structured resonance.

Inspired by lived experience and ethical commitment, FeeroLink treats "visual structure" as a philosophical interface.

üõ† Technology Backbone

A Viewer interface using Cytoscape.js to map and navigate thought structures

JSON-based node structures that encode meaning, emotion, and connection

Markdown-based knowledge modules with multilingual support

Future readiness for integration with Neuralink or sensory-extension interfaces

üß© Modular Components

FeeroLink Studio: A real-world implementation space for tech, education, and community healing

FeeroMap_Care: A welfare-centered application for visualizing support relationships and enabling non-verbal communication

FeeroLink Philosophy: Markdown-based visual and conceptual documentation (e.g., Master Diagram, Core Statements)

üåç Global Orientation

Written in both Japanese and English for universal access

Emphasizes inclusion, welfare, trauma support, and ethical co-creation with AI
