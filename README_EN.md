# FeeroLink — A Structural Interface for Dignity and Thought

## 🌌 What is FeeroLink?

FeeroLink is a visual thinking-based cognitive system designed to:

* Convert thoughts, emotions, and memories into structured "nodes"
* Connect them through meaningful relations and abstract tags
* Visualize your inner universe as an editable, navigable structure

It is both a philosophical architecture and a cognitive interface — one that allows human dignity and non-verbal concepts to be preserved, connected, and shared.

## 🧠 Who is it for?

FeeroLink is designed for:

* Visual thinkers
* Philosophers, designers, creators
* People interested in mapping thought, emotion, or worldview
* Those who want to preserve the unspoken parts of their mind

## 🖥️ FeeroLink Viewer

This is the interactive tool that visualizes the FeeroLink universe.
You can:

* Add nodes (title, description, tag)
* Connect nodes
* Filter and color nodes by tag
* Save/load your entire conceptual map (JSON)

**Live demo:** [FeeroLink Viewer](https://feerolink-creator.github.io/FeeroLink/)

## 🧭 Philosophical Background

FeeroLink was born from the idea that we already live in a “post-crime world” — where unseen structural violence has shaped what survives and what is silenced.
It asks:

* What if intelligence, diversity, and otherness were already filtered?
* Can we design systems that embed dignity and prevent future erasure?

## 🌀 Structural Model: Dignity-Centered Circular Design

* ![Dignity Model EN](./docs/VisualThoughtModels/dignity_model_en.jpg)

This model outlines the layered structural conditions necessary to uphold human dignity. It is meant for use in ethics, design, welfare, and education.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
